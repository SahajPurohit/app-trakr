Are you tired of using a spreadsheet to keep track of your internship applications? Wish there was a better way to keep track of your internship applications? Well friend, wish and be tired no longer! With app-trakr you can monitor your internship applications in much a more sophisticated way.

"But why would I want to keep track of my applications in the first place? Can't I just respond to each company when they get back to me by email?" I hear you ask. There are many reasons as to why it is beneficial to keep track of your applications:

- You can quickly see how many applications you have submitted in total, how many applications are still being reviewed, etc.
- Some companies can take a while to get back to you. If and when a company does get back to you, you can easily see when they last contacted you, what positioned you applied for, when you applied, etc.
- After you have submitted a lot of applications, sometimes you may come upon a job listing and forget that you have already applied to it in the past. Having a list of all your applications can help you avoid submitting duplicate applications, or worse, not applying to a role because you mistakenly remembered having applied to it in the past.

These are just a few reasons.
